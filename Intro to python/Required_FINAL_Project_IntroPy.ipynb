The code should also consider using most of the following (`.upper()` or `.lower()`, `.title()`, `print(\"hello\",end=\"\")` `else`, `elif`, `range()`, `while`, `.close()`) |\n\n\n## Program: Element_Quiz  \nIn this program the user enters the name of any 5 of the first 20 Atomic Elements and is given a grade and test report for items correct and incorrect.  \n\n\n### Sample input and output:  \n```\nlist any 5 of the first 20 elements in the Period table\nEnter the name of an element: argon\nEnter the name of an element: chlorine\nEnter the name of an element: sodium\nEnter the name of an element: argon\nargon was already entered          <--no duplicates allowed\nEnter the name of an element: helium\nEnter the name of an element: gold\n\n80 % correct\nFound: Argon Chlorine Sodium Helium \nNot Found: Gold \n```  \n\n\n### Create get_names() Function to collect input of 5 unique element names  \n\n- The function accepts no arguments and returns a list of 5 input strings (element names)  \n- define a list to hold the input\n- collect input of a element name  \n- if input it is **not** already in the list add the input to the list  \n- don't allow empty strings as input  \n- once 5 unique inputs **return** the list  \n\n\n### Create the Program flow  \n\n#### import the file into the Jupyter Notebook environment   \n\n- use `!curl` to download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/intropython/master/elements1_20.txt\" as `elements1_20.txt`  \n- open the file with the first 20 elements  \n- read one line at a time to get element names, remove any whitespace (spaces, newlines) and save each element name, as lowercase, into a list  \n\n\n####  Call the get_names() function  \n\n- the return value will be the quiz responses list  \n\n#### check if responses are in the list of elements  \nIterate through 5 responses  \n- compare each response to the list of 20 elements\n  - any response that is in the list of 20 elements is correct and should be added to a list of correct responses  \n  - if not in the list of 20 elements then add to a list of incorrect responses  \n\n#### calculate the % correct  \n \n - find the the number of items in the correct responses and divide by 5, this will result in answers like 1.0, .8, .6,...  \n - to get the % multiple the calculated answer above by 100, this will result in answers like 100, 80, 60...  \n - *hint: instead of dividing by 5 and then multiplying by 100, the number of correct responses can be multiplied by 20*  \n\n#### Print output  \n\n- print the Score % right  \n- print each of the correct responses  \n- print each of the incorrect responses  \n\n\n### create Element_Quiz  then paste code on edX submission page\n\n"
